## Abstract
This study is a reproduction of a Middebury Geography Indroductory GIS Lab problem titled "Exposure to Environmental Hazards: Hurricane Harvey." The original study focused on comparing levels of flooding across block groups of different majority demographics. The original study used the desktop GIS QGIS to determine the majority racial group in every block group in Harris County, Texas and then compared these data to the extent of flooding from Hurricane Harvey. This reproduction study aims to reproduce the same results from the original lab problem using a Python computation notebook (ipynb) as opposed to a desktop GIS workflow. The notebook will potentially serve as an opportunity to demonstrate using Python to complete simple GIS problems in the context of an introductory Human Geography with GIS class.

## Compendium structure and contents

This research compendium is structured with four main directories:

- `data`: contains subdirectories for `raw` data and `derived` data.
- `docs`: contains subdirectories for `manuscript`, `presentation`, and `report`
- `procedure`: contains subdirectories for `code` or software scripts, information about the computational `environment` in which the research was conducted, and non-code research `protocols`
- `results`: contains subdirectories for `figures`, formatted data `tables`, or `other` formats of research results.

The data, procedures, and results of this repository are outlined in three tables:
- Data: [data/data_index.csv](data/data_index.csv)
- Procedures: [procedure/procedure_index.csv](procedure/procedure_index.csv)
- Results: [results/results_index.csv](results/results_index.csv)

Important local **documents** include:
- Pre-analysis plan: [docs/report/preanalysis.pdf](docs/report/preanalysis.pdf)
- Study report: [docs/report/report.pdf](docs/report/report.pdf)
- Manuscript: [docs/manuscript/manuscript.pdf](docs/manuscript/manuscript.pdf)
